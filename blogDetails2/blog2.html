          <h2>ANYBODY CAN BE DEPRESSED.</h2>
          <p>
            Jane struggles daily to get out of bed. Waking up is the easy part,
            but finding the drive to move about the day is usually a herculean
            task.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jane’s life seemed perfect on the outside. Everyone said she had the
            perfect parents, wealthy status, and great school grades. So why was
            she always in a gloom and doom state?
            <br />
            <br />
            Felicity knew what suffering tasted like, coming from a home where 3
            square meals were a luxury and hand-me-downs were the only fashion
            statements she owned. Her life was already so bleak, so it was
            understandable that she would sink lower and lower into depression.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jane and felicity though from different life spectrums, both suffer
            from massive bouts of depression. This just about proves that
            anybody can be depressed.
            <br />
            <br />
            Feeling depressed is one of the common symptoms of being human, and
            you can't control that it happens. The issue is that we felt ashamed
            of it but the only way to feel good again is to face it.
            <br />
            External factors do not dictate who suffers from this mental
            illness, it is a health factor that controls the way we think and
            act. Sad feelings are common with every human; hence, anybody can
            slip into depression due to aggravated bouts of sadness.
            <br />
            Factors that promote depression are mostly internal and stem from
            several issues.
            <br />
            The major factors of depression are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Family genes</li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>2. Chronic stress</li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>3. Traumatic experiences</li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>4. Unresolved grief from the loss</li>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>5. Medication and substance use.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          <!-- start -->
          <div class="first__one">
            <h3>FAMILY GENES:</h3>
            <p>
              Depression can run in families as there are genes like the
              Serotonin transporter gene that promote the feelings of
              depression. This means that members of the same family can fall
              into depression at certain times in their lives. Hormonal
              imbalance is a contributing factor to depression, and through
              medications, it can be treated.
              <br />
              <br />
              Depression stems from the inside, promoted by negative thought
              patterns, overthinking, and intense worry. A person suffering from
              low self-esteem or dealing with lots of criticism can very well
              fall into depressive sessions and lose the will to carry out daily
              functions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="first__one">
            <h3>2. TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES:</h3>
            <p>
              Another determinant of depression is life experiences. Some
              traumatic experiences can make a person get stuck in a web of
              self-deprecating thoughts which develop into feelings of
              self-loathing and thoughts that make being alive a chore.
              <br />
              <br />
              Some persons blame themselves for these situations and this leads
              them to sink into dark harmful thoughts that compound to
              depression.
              <br />
              <br />
              Depression affects people despite their social standing in life or
              what their situations look like on the outside. Social
              environments like growing up in an unstable family, violent
              environment, or abusive relationships all work as factors that
              promote depression.
              <br />
              <br />
              Depression is not a personal weakness; it is a treatable mental
              illness that is not limited to certain persons.
              <br />
              <br />
              There is yet no proven preventive measure, as it has no singular
              cause for it. It is treatable though, as drugs like
              antidepressants and hormone boosters help to reduce the rate of
              depression.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="first__one">
            <h3>3. CHRONIC STRESS</h3>
            <p>
              Stress also plays an effective role in fostering depression,
              workplace stress can get overwhelming. From nasty bosses to nosy
              and disruptive co-workers, the work overload can also increase
              stress levels which can develop into depression.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sometimes people set unrealistic standards that are unachievable
              and when they cannot reach that standard, they fall into feelings
              of sadness which escalate into depression.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="first__one">
            <h3>4. UNRESOLVED GRIEF /LOSS</h3>
            <p>
              Losing a family member or loved one leaves quite a gaping hole in
              hearts, and some persons never heal from this grief no matter how
              long it takes. Even years later, the pain of the loss remains
              fresh and the possibility of slipping into depression is quite
              high.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="first__one">
            <h3>5. MEDICATION AND SUBSTANCE USE:</h3>
            <p>
              Some drugs can alter brain chemicals they are usually side effects
              from treating certain conditions.
              <br />
              <br />
              The use of substances also induces depression, because it alters
              brain activity and causes heightened emotions which die down after
              a while and leave room for thoughts that foster depression.
              <br />
              <br />
              From these factors, you can see that depression is not just for
              certain persons, but can affect any person.
            </p>

          <div class="dealing">
            <h3>Here’s How to deal with depression:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Talk through the feelings</li>
              <br />
              <li>
                2. Believe that it is a phase that will pass with the right
                treatment.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                3. Build an internal and external support system to help you get
                through it.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Conclusion: In the end, we are all just people trying to get
              through life. If someone tells us they are depressed, help them
              instead of trying to make it seem like it was their fault. We are
              all just here trying to get through life
