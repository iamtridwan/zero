          <h2>THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE CHOOSING A COUNSELOR OR THERAPIST.</h2>
          <p>
            When you found out you need therapy. Sometimes, choosing the right
            therapist becomes a difficult task. Because every human being is
            unique and we want the best counselor who will handle our problems
            very well and proffer the best solutions. It is a fact that a good
            therapist or counselor will help you to improve your mental health.
            But the question remains, how do you get a good therapist/counselor?
            <br />
            <br />
            This article will narrow you down on things that are necessary for
            you to consider before choosing a therapist:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>1. Personality and a good match:</h3>
              <p>
                This is very crucial because it's important to find someone that
                resonates with you. Your friends might recommend someone to
                you—because of how the person helped them and how great their
                sessions with the therapist were. Nevertheless, you must know
                that someone that was a good match for your friend might not be
                the same for you. We are all unique, with different
                personalities. How do you want your therapist to be? Maybe
                cheerful and Jovial or bold and straight to the point. You might
                want someone that communicates warmly and friendly, so you can
                trust them before you pour out your thoughts, feelings, and
                problems to them.
                <br />
                <br />
                It's important that a good therapist rapport with you. Though
                the last thing they will do is to give you hope; they will
                believe in you and your progress.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finding a good match in a therapist is a sure pill and the first
                step to improving your mental state. Edward Bordin in his
                research about therapeutic alliance; a relationship between a
                therapist and his client said that this alliance facilitates a
                positive change and growth.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>2. What is your preference:</h3>
              <p>
                How do you want your therapist to be, in terms of age, gender,
                ethnic background, religion, and language?
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Gender:</strong> You might want a specific gender as
                your therapist. You need to be open about lots of things since
                there are social, emotional, and psychological differences
                between the two genders. You might not be comfortable discussing
                some things with the opposite gender.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Age:</strong> You might not also want a younger person
                or an older person as your therapist. So consider your age and
                the age of your therapist. There’s no harm in going with your
                instinct.
                <br />
                <br />
                It's your preference, strongly consider them before you make the
                mistake of choosing someone that has a quality contrary to your
                guts.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Language:</strong> Sometimes people want someone that
                could converse in their native language because they feel
                comfortable and relaxed when they communicate in their native
                language. Don’t think you won’t find these qualities. Add them
                to your preference and consider them when you are looking for a
                therapist.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>3. How experienced do you want your therapist to be:</h3>
              <p>
                Some people are indeed skilled at giving advice and helping you
                strive mentally. However, you might not want just anybody with a
                level of education but a therapist with a degree,
                certifications, and license for sure.
                <br />
                <br />
                If this would assure you that your therapist knows what they are
                doing then look for a therapist their certificates and
                experience will convince you that you are in good hands. Make a
                research about their educational background, read their bio. If
                you're satisfied with it, then you're good to go.
                <br />
                <br />
                You can also look for a therapist qualified in a specialty that
                suits your problem. instinct.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some therapists are experienced in working with children, or
                people with a particular problem.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>4. Scheduling :</h3>
              <p>
                You should consider the time and days that suit you and the time
                your potential therapist is available, also how far or close,
                you'd have to commute to get to your therapist. If you prefer
                the therapist that stay at a far location but they help you make
                progress and improve. Then it's worth adjusting your schedule
                and driving far to meet them.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>5. Do you prefer an online session?</h3>
              <p>
                Some people love scheduling and meeting their therapist through
                online video calls and texts. Because it saves time, stress, and
                the cost of transportation. While other people enjoy online
                sessions and believe it's more convenient for them. So you might
                want to consider this, so you'll get in touch with a therapist
                that offers online therapy.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>6. Cost of therapy:</h3>
              <p>
                I think this is one of the first things to consider while
                choosing a therapist.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some of them charge hourly and might not be affordable for you.
                You don't need to pay a price that'd add more burden and stress
                your mental health. If you can't afford the therapist you like,
                you might consider looking for the one you like—at the rate, you
                can pay.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>7. Read reviews of their previous patients.</h3>
              <p>
                Reviews from their previous patients will give you an idea of
                how they operate. If the therapist is friendly and answers
                patients' questions well. How well he relates with his clients.
                What the patient feels about the environment, staff, and
                therapist. Their experiences will guide you to make a good
                decision.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>8. On your first visit:</h3>
              <p>
                You might consider paying attention to some things on your first
                visit to them.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you feel comfortable talking with them and how they reply. A
                good therapist does not need to talk too much about themselves
                without allowing you to talk about yours. They won't judge you
                negatively based on the things, you tell them. Certainly, a good
                therapist will not act like they know it all.
                <br />
                <br />
                Also, you can ask questions based on their expertise—some
                counselors are experienced in young adults while some help
                treats older people. Other questions can be based on their
                license, experience, and how they plan to help you.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you think you don't click or connect with the therapist after
                your first visit, and maybe after subsequent visits. Don't feel
                compelled to remain with them. It's very normal to not get that
                connection
                <br />
                <br />
                with a therapist. It doesn't mean they are bad therapists
                either. You can always request another therapist or you look for
                recommendations. The main aim is to get someone that matches you
                totally and will help you improve.
