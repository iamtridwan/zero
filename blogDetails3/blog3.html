          <p>
            In recent times, there has been a high trend of depression cases and
            this mental disorder cuts across people from all age groups,
            backgrounds and nationalities. According to WHO's 2017 yearly
            report, an estimated 3.8% of the world population is affected with
            depression, which is approximately 280 million people. Wow! It
            doesn't help that in this part of the world, it's easier to wave off
            people with depression with the slang 'Na sapa dey worry you, no be
            depression' which is appalling, because unlike other mental
            disorders, depression sometimes occur in a way that is similar to
            mood swings and as such people who are depressed would probably
            think they have mood fluctuations and carry on in their depressive
            states without getting help. Also, the social stigma associated with
            people who suffer depression in this part of the world should be
            frowned upon because not only are they stigmatized, their condition
            is made very humorous that most times they become recluse, go back
            into their shells and carry on with their depressive moods and this
            doesn't help the society in the long run because they end up being a
            menace to their family, community, kindred etc
          </p>
          <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
          <p>
            Depression is a mental and behavioral disorder that involves a
            persistent feeling of sadness,loss of interest and pleasure in
            activities. It's worth noting that it's a norm to feel sad or low
            sometimes but this feeling which is better known as mood swings
            usually stops after some time and it is quite different from
            depression, as depression is persistent, recurring and can last for
            a long time if help is not rendered
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Symptoms and patterns of Depression</h2>
          <p>
            Whether it's the new mom who can't guess why she's feeling glum or
            that toddler who is all cranky or the teenager who wants to sleep
            all day and find nothing worth doing, depressive moods all have
            similar patterns of being sad, irritable, empty and hopeless. Lack
            of concentration, feelings of excessive low self-esteem and worth,
            loss of interest and pleasure in activities, increase in purposeless
            physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing,
            handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be
            severe enough to be observable by others) Feeling worthless,
            thoughts of suicide, weight gain/loss which can't be traced to a
            dieting program are all inclusive of depressive symptoms. Although
            these symptoms might vary from mild to severe, symptoms of
            depression must last at least two weeks and a noticeable change in
            the level of functioning before depression can be diagnosed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Causes of Depression</h2>
          <p>
            Researchers haven't been able to pinpoint a particular cause of
            depression, as depression can be triggered or occur for a variety of
            reasons which includes but not limited to:
            <br />
            <strong>Trauma and Abuse:</strong> People who have had traumatic
            experience and people who have suffered abuse(emotional, sexual,
            physical) are more likely to go through depression.
            <br />
            <strong>Personality:</strong> People who have certain personality
            traits such as extremely low self-esteem, overly self-critical are
            more vulnerable to trigger depressive moods
            <br />
            <strong>Illness:</strong> Sometimes, people who have
            life-threatening illness or long-standing illness such as cancer,
            heart disease can easily be triggered into depressive moods as the
            illness is taking a toll on their overall wellbeing.
            <br />
            <strong>Environmental factors:</strong> An environment that exposes
            people to violence, neglect, abuse, poverty and disease have a
            higher chance of producing more depressed people.
            <br />
            <strong>Genetics:</strong> If you have a family history of
            depression, then you are susceptible to having depression as
            researches have shown that there is a high degree of heritability
            (approximately 40%) when first-degree relatives
            (parents/children/siblings) have depression.
          </p>
          <h2>Effects of Depression</h2>
          <p>
            As much as depression is a mental illness, it has great effects on
            our physical and overall well being.
            <br />
            Some of the effects of depression are:
            <br />
            <strong>Trouble with memory or making decisions:</strong> Cognitive
            changes such as trouble remembering things or making decisions
            affect people with depression.
            <br />
            <strong>Risk of heart attack:</strong> Studies have shown that
            people in depressive state stand a chance of having a heart attack.
            <br />
            <strong>Insomnia:</strong> Depression can make you have abnormal
            sleep patterns or no sleep at all as this can be a result of
            difficulty in concentration
            <br />
            <strong>Fatigue:</strong> Depression reduces the energy level of the
            body and this makes one with depression tire out easily and feel
            fatigued
            <br />
            <strong>Suicide thoughts:</strong> Depression can make the mind
            preoccupied with thoughts of hurting oneself which increases the
            risk of committing suicide.
          </p>
          <h2>Treatment of Depression</h2>
          <p>
            We've come to the good part which is, there is definitely help for
            people going through depression. Depression is among the most
            treatable of mental disorders. Most patients with depression gain
            relief from their symptoms and respond well to treatment. Treatment
            of depression comes in two major forms which are:
            <br />
            <strong>Medication:</strong> The chemistry of the brain may
            contribute to one's depression and for this reason there are
            antidepressants which normalize the brain changes associated with
            depression. Now, these antidepressant drugs are best prescribed by
            your doctor or your therapist as they would know which one is
            suitable for your level of depression. Although long term use of
            these antidepressants may be suggested to reduce the risk of future
            occurrence for certain people at high risk
            <br />
            <strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Talking to a licensed
            psychotherapist about how you feel is a great start to treating
            depression. Although this therapy is sometimes used for only mild
            depression. Moderate and severe depression combine therapy with
            medications. Therapists also prescribe other natural remedies and
            tips such as acupuncture, exercise, meditation etc to help cure
            depression.
            <br />
            Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a
            few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can
            be made in 10 to 15 sessions.
            <br />
            Pertinent to know that these are not the only way a depressed person
            can get help, you and I can also help by being kind, spreading love
            and light to them, reassuring them that they're worthy and more than
            enough, give a listening ear to them and do not wave them off or
            stigmatize or make humor out of their condition.
